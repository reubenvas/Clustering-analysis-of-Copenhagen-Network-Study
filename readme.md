# Data Mining Group Project - Clustering analysis of Copenhagen students

## Overview
In this project, our team employed advanced data mining techniques to analyze the Copenhagen Networks Study data. The goal was to understand social dynamics through interaction patterns captured via SMS, calls, and Bluetooth proximity.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
- **Source:** Interaction records from the [Copenhagen Network Study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0325-x), including SMS, call logs, and Bluetooth proximity.
- **Preprocessing:** Detailed steps involving data cleaning, normalization, and handling of missing data to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Objectives
- To identify and analyze clusters of participants based on their interaction patterns.
- To interpret the social dynamics and networking behavior within the Copenhagen Networks Study.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Describing in-depth the process of acquiring and preparing the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed analysis of interaction measures, including statistical analysis and visualization techniques used to understand data characteristics.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Elaborate on the specific features engineered for effective clustering, and the rationale behind their selection.
4. **Clustering Approach:** Detailed methodology of the K-means clustering algorithm, including the selection of K, the clustering process, and validation methods.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA used, the rationale behind choosing them, and their impact on the results.

## Results and Discussion
- **Cluster Analysis:** In-depth analysis of each identified cluster, including their characteristics and what they signify in terms of social interactions.
- **Insights Gained:** Detailed discussion on the insights obtained from the clustering regarding social dynamics and interaction patterns.
